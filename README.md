# 📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Machine Learning Project

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the working of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** algorithm in Machine Learning. It includes generating a synthetic dataset, visualizing data distribution, and applying K-NN for classification. The project is implemented using Python and key libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Dataset Generation**: Synthetic dataset with two features and two classes.
- 🎨 **Data Visualization**: Scatter plot representation of the dataset.
- 🤖 **K-NN Model Implementation**: Using `sklearn` to train and evaluate the model.
- 📈 **Performance Metrics**: Classification report and accuracy score.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` – for numerical operations
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` – for visualization
  - `sklearn` – for machine learning model implementation

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KNN-ML-Project.git
   cd KNN-ML-Project
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook K_NN_ML.ipynb
   ```

## 🎯 Usage
- Open the notebook in Jupyter.
- Run each cell step by step to understand how K-NN works.
- Modify the hyperparameters (e.g., number of neighbors) to observe changes in classification.
